Both fixes live in one launcher per platform (`launcher/claudemax` and `launcher/claudemax.win.js`), each fix independently switchable by an environment variable (see [`launcher/README.md`](launcher/README.md) for the toggle table). The node launcher compiles to a single `claudemax.exe` with `pkg` - one binary per platform carrying every fix, down from one exe per fix. The standalone per-fix tools under `fixes/` cover the non-launcher delivery paths.

# Workaround 1: empty thinking summaries

Request-level mechanics, the live A/B confirmation, and the proxy design for the empty-thinking-summaries fix on Opus 4.7 / 4.8.

## TL;DR

The Messages API `thinking.display` field decides whether summarized thinking is returned. On Opus 4.7 / 4.8 it defaults to `"omitted"`, so unless the request explicitly carries `thinking: {type: "adaptive", display: "summarized"}`, the thinking block streams back with an empty `thinking` string. The setting meant to opt you in, `showThinkingSummaries`, is honored only in interactive (TUI) mode, and the VS Code extension and headless `-p`/SDK drive the CLI non-interactively, so the setting is silently skipped on exactly the surfaces people complain about. The `--thinking-display summarized` CLI flag is not interactivity-gated, so forcing it (or the equivalent wire field) fixes the problem.

There is no raw/full thinking mode: the only valid `display` values are `"summarized"` and `"omitted"`.

## Root cause (from the installed CLI)

The request builder inside the CLI picks `display` like this (function names from a native-installer 2.1.x binary; logic is the same across install types):

```js
function p6(){ return !isInteractive }                    // p6() === "NOT interactive"
function EK8(){ return settings.showThinkingSummaries ?? false }

// request builder:
if (thinkingDisplay === "summarized" || thinkingDisplay === "omitted")
    pz.display = thinkingDisplay;            // <- the --thinking-display flag (ungated)
else if (!p6() && EK8())                     // <- (isInteractive && showThinkingSummaries)
    pz.display = "summarized";
// else: pz.display stays undefined -> server defaults to "omitted"
```

Two ways to set `display`:

1. The `--thinking-display` flag, always honored regardless of interactivity.
2. The `showThinkingSummaries` setting, honored only when `isInteractive`.

The VS Code extension launches the CLI with `--input-format stream-json` (i.e. non-interactive), so path #2 never fires. That leaves path #1, the flag, as the only lever. But the extension builds the thinking args like this:

```js
// extension.js, simplified (the array variable is minified; it is `q` in 2.1.16x,
// `B` in 2.0.x, and so on):
let q = ["--output-format","stream-json","--verbose","--input-format","stream-json"];
// adaptive thinking mode:        q.push("--thinking", "adaptive");
// budget thinking mode (2.1.16x): q.push("--max-thinking-tokens", l.budgetTokens.toString());
if (l.type !== "disabled" && l.display) q.push("--thinking-display", l.display);
```

`l.display` is only ever set if some upstream layer already set it, and nothing maps `showThinkingSummaries` onto it. The literal string `"summarized"` occurs 0 times in `extension.js`; `showThinkingSummaries` appears only in the settings *schema*, never in the request path. So `l.display` is always undefined, `--thinking-display` is never passed, the binary is non-interactive so the setting gate is also skipped, `display` stays undefined, the server defaults to `"omitted"`, and you get empty thinking even with `showThinkingSummaries: true`.

Two extension-side details changed in the 2.1.16x line and matter for the launcher (Option 1):

1. **Thinking signal.** The VS Code path now emits `--max-thinking-tokens <budgetTokens>` for its (default) budget thinking mode, not `--thinking adaptive`; `--thinking adaptive` is only emitted for the explicit adaptive mode. A launcher that triggers solely on `--thinking adaptive`/`-p` therefore never fires from the extension, which is why the previous launcher version stopped working when the extension updated.
2. **Process-wrapper calling convention.** When the `claudeCode.claudeProcessWrapper` setting is set, `resolveClaudeBinary()` returns `{pathToClaudeCodeExecutable: <wrapper>, executableArgs: [<realBinary>]}` (or `[<node>, <cli.js>]` when a bundled `cli.js` is used instead of a native binary). So the wrapper is invoked as `<wrapper> <realBinary> <args...>`, with the real CLI as a leading argument. The launcher detects and consumes that leading path; otherwise it would be forwarded to the real CLI as a stray positional.

## Behavior matrix

| Surface | `showThinkingSummaries: true` | `--thinking-display summarized` |
|---|:--:|:--:|
| Interactive terminal (TUI) | Works (`isInteractive` true) | Works |
| `claude -p` / headless / SDK | Ignored (`isInteractive` false) | Works |
| VS Code extension | Ignored (non-interactive, never mapped) | Works (extension just never sends it) |

This is why the interactive terminal was never broken and needs no fix, while the extension and headless paths show empty thinking. Note that on the VS Code path the current extension marks a real run with `--max-thinking-tokens`, not `--thinking adaptive`; the launcher keys off either.

## Confirmation (live A/B, headless)

Same prompt, run twice through a logged-in account on Opus 4.8 with `claude -p ... --output-format stream-json --verbose`:

| Run | thinking block |
|---|---|
| `--thinking-display summarized` | populated (hundreds of chars) |
| no flag, `showThinkingSummaries: true` | empty (0 chars) |

This proves three things: (1) `display: "summarized"` works end-to-end on 4.8, the server honors it; (2) the setting is ignored in non-interactive mode; (3) the flag is the lever. Reproduce it yourself with [`test-thinking-display.sh`](fixes/thinking-summaries/test-thinking-display.sh) (sends two small live requests; uses a few tokens).

VS Code UI was confirmed separately: after applying the Option 2 patch and reloading the window, thinking summaries render in the conversation on Opus 4.8. The fix has also been observed to survive an extension auto-update where `patch-extension.sh` had patched multiple installed versions.

## How each workaround applies the lever

### Option 1: launcher

Claude Code places one of these markers on the command line for real agent runs: `--max-thinking-tokens N` (the current VS Code extension's budget mode), `--thinking adaptive`/`enabled` (SDK and older extensions), or `-p`/`--print` (headless). The launcher inspects the args and, when it detects a real run via any of those markers, appends `--thinking-display summarized` before `exec`'ing the real `claude`. It also strips a leading real-binary path when the official extension passes one (the process-wrapper convention above), handling both a single native-binary path and a `node` + `cli.js` pair. Because it lives *outside* the app:

- it survives extension/CLI updates (nothing in Claude's install is modified);
- one wrapper covers both the VS Code extension and headless `-p`/SDK;
- the injection is guarded so it only fires on real runs (never on `mcp`, `config`, `--version`, etc.), never when thinking is explicitly `disabled`, and never twice (so it coexists with a patched or updated extension);
- `CC_THINKING_DISPLAY=omitted` flips it off without editing anything.

The launcher intentionally sets no environment of its own by default; it only adds the flag. Effort level, timeouts, and alternate-backend routing are available as commented, opt-in customizations in the script.

### Option 2: extension.js patch

> **Unmaintained.** Documented for reference. VS Code only, and must be re-applied after every extension update; the launcher (Option 1) is the supported fix.

A one-line change so the non-interactive spawn always forwards the flag:

```js
// from:
if(l.type!=="disabled"&&l.display)B.push("--thinking-display",l.display)
// to:
if(l.type!=="disabled")B.push("--thinking-display",l.display||"summarized")
```

The array variable (`B` here) is minified and renames between builds (`q` in 2.1.16x), so `patch-extension.sh` matches it with a capture group rather than a fixed literal and preserves whatever name the build uses. A hand edit should keep the surrounding build's variable name.

[`patch-extension.sh`](fixes/thinking-summaries/patch-extension.sh) applies this idempotently across all installed Claude Code extensions (backing up each first), with `--revert` and `--dry-run`. It must be re-applied after every extension update (the install folder is replaced on upgrade), and it only fixes VS Code; headless/SDK still need Option 1.

Toggle idea (untested): changing the line to `l.display || (process.env.CC_THINKING_DISPLAY || "summarized")` would let a `CC_THINKING_DISPLAY=omitted` env var (e.g. in VS Code `settings.json`) hide thinking while unset/`summarized` shows it, a way to honor an on/off switch without a code change each time. Not tested.

### Option 3: local proxy (design)

> **Unmaintained and untested.** A design and a working starting point, not a turnkey fix; it sits in the path of your live auth token. The launcher (Option 1) is the supported fix.
>
> **2026-07-07:** on current builds, overriding `ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL` makes the CLI build a *different* request (it detects a non-first-party base URL), so this proxy is no longer a byte-faithful passthrough - see the [replication warning](#replication-warning-base-url-proxies-change-the-request).

The most thorough fix: a small localhost forward proxy that injects the field at the wire level, so it is surface-agnostic (VS Code + CLI + SDK), needs no install edits, and survives updates. It works because every Claude Code surface resolves the API host as:

```
... ?? process.env.ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL ?? "https://api.anthropic.com"
```

Point `ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL` at the proxy and every request flows through it.

What the proxy does ([`proxy.js`](fixes/thinking-summaries/proxy.js)):

1. Accept requests on `http://127.0.0.1:<port>`.
2. For `POST /v1/messages`, parse the JSON body; if `body.thinking.type` is `"adaptive"` or `"enabled"` and `body.thinking.display` is unset, set it to the configured value (default `"summarized"`, or `"omitted"` to hide).
3. Forward everything else to `https://api.anthropic.com` unchanged: headers (incl. `x-api-key` / `Authorization: Bearer`, `anthropic-version`, `anthropic-beta`), query string, and the streaming SSE response body.
4. Stream the response straight back (no buffering, so `--output-format stream-json` and the UI keep working).

This doubles as the toggle: the injected value is read from `CC_THINKING_DISPLAY`, so flipping between `summarized` and `omitted` is just a restart with a different env var.

Security / trust notes (important):

- The proxy sees your live auth token. Keep it bound to 127.0.0.1 only, never `0.0.0.0`. Don't log headers/bodies except when actively debugging, and never to a shared path.
- Simplest TLS model: terminate plain HTTP locally and let the proxy make the upstream TLS call to api.anthropic.com (client to `http://127.0.0.1`, then on to the https upstream). Confirm your build accepts an `http://` localhost base URL; some builds may force https, in which case add a self-signed cert + `NODE_EXTRA_CA_CERTS`, or use a tool like `mitmproxy` with an addon that does the same body rewrite.
- Fully reversible: unset `ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL` to talk to Anthropic directly again.

Status: provided as a working starting point but not extensively tested, so validate the localhost-base-URL behavior before relying on it.

## Notes

- Summary length tracks effort. The detail/length of the summaries corresponds to the reasoning effort level, and at high effort (e.g. `CLAUDE_CODE_EFFORT_LEVEL=xhigh`) the summaries are long and read almost like full reasoning. Higher effort uses more tokens.
- Why hooks / plugins / MCP can't do this. None of them can modify the `/v1/messages` request body or the thinking config; they operate on tool/lifecycle events only, and the request is built inside the CLI. The only levers are: the `--thinking-display` flag, the (interactive-only) setting, an `extension.js`/binary patch, or a wire-level proxy.

## Compatibility

Confirmed on Opus 4.7 / 4.8 with VS Code extension `2.1.169` (native-binary CLI), via the `claudeCode.claudeProcessWrapper` setting, on Windows 11 and Ubuntu 24.04; earlier confirmations were on `2.1.165` / `2.1.167` (which signaled thinking with `--thinking adaptive`). The CLI flag and the request field are stable levers, but the exact minified strings used by [`patch-extension.sh`](fixes/thinking-summaries/patch-extension.sh) (Option 2) can change between extension releases (e.g. the array variable `B` -> `q`); the script matches the variable generically and, if the surrounding pattern isn't found, skips and tells you to inspect manually. Options 1 and 3 don't depend on internal strings.

**2026-07-07:** on `claude-opus-4-8` only, a server-side experiment can blank summaries regardless of the flag; see the next section. The flag remains correct and sufficient for other models and for installs not carrying the assignment.

## 2026-07-07 update: server-side experiment blanks Opus 4.8 summaries

A second, independent mechanism, discovered 2026-07-07 (times below are HST,
UTC-10). It is unrelated to the client-side `display` gap above: here the
request provably carries `display: "summarized"` and the server withholds the
summary text anyway - on exactly one model.

### Symptom and timeline

* Same machine, same account, same CLI binary (`2.1.202` native): sessions
  through 19:12 returned multi-thousand-character summaries on Opus 4.8;
  the next session at 19:58 and everything after returned `thinking` strings of
  length 0 with valid signatures. No client component changed in between
  (`2.1.203`/`2.1.204` behave identically; version-chasing was a red herring).
* Claude Code's feature-flag client (a remote-eval gating client refreshed at
  session start and on a 6-hour timer) cached a new experiment assignment in
  `~/.claude.json` at **19:12:18** - the exact break boundary:

  ```json
  "experimentKey": "claude_code_attic_parcel_experiment",
  "atis": "attic-parcel-meridian"
  ```

### Mechanism (from the 2.1.204 native binary)

The cached value is read back and attached as a request header on every
first-party API call, in the CLI's shared fetch wrapper (all surfaces):

```js
Yvi = "x-cc-atis"
function Xvi(){ let e = cL()?.atis; return typeof e === "string" && e.length > 0 ? e : void 0 }
// fetch wrapper, first-party path:
if (o) { let m = Xvi(); if (m !== void 0) a.set(Yvi, m) }
// cL() reads clientDataCacheSlots / clientDataCache from ~/.claude.json
```

With `x-cc-atis: attic-parcel-meridian` present, the API returns Opus 4.8
thinking blocks with a valid `signature` and an empty `thinking` string. The
reasoning still runs and still consumes tokens; only the text is withheld.

### Evidence (single-variable A/B, one binary `2.1.204`, one account, minutes apart)

Request body in every run below carried `thinking: {type: "adaptive", display: "summarized"}`
(wire-observed through a local forwarder that logged only the body's `model` +
`thinking` fields and response thinking lengths - never headers):

| Run | `x-cc-atis` on the wire | Opus 4.8 `thinking` length |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Direct, assignment cached | yes | **0** (sig present; repeated: sig 512/540/564/836) |
| Identical request, header stripped in flight | no | **226** |
| Assignment purged from config + `DISABLE_GROWTHBOOK=1`, direct-shape request | no (verified) | **65** |
| `DISABLE_GROWTHBOOK=1` alone (cache not purged) | yes | **0** |

Model scope, same flags, same account, direct path: Opus 4.7 -> 179 chars,
Sonnet 5 -> 253, Haiku 4.5 -> 528, Fable 5 -> populated (VS Code path), Opus
4.8 -> 0. All Opus 4.8 alias spellings (`opus`, `[1m]` variants) behave the
same. Transport was ruled out (HTTP/1.1 and HTTP/2 upstream legs, and
`accept-encoding` forwarded verbatim, all behave the same once the header is
controlled for).

### Why no launch flag or env var can override it

* The flag path is intact: `--thinking-display summarized` still lands in the
  request (`display` is wire-confirmed present). The server ignores it while
  the header is present, so argument injection - this repo's Option 1 - cannot help.
* On first-party auth the CLI hard-forces `thinking.type: "adaptive"` for
  Opus 4.8 (capability-gated; the only override hook is a server-rejection
  retry), and the `ANTHROPIC_*_SUPPORTED_CAPABILITIES` override envs are
  disabled on first-party. There is no request shape the client can be
  configured into that avoids the behavior.
* `DISABLE_GROWTHBOOK=1` stops future refreshes but the already-cached value is
  still read and sent (measured above), hence the two-step mitigation.

### Replication warning: base-URL proxies change the request

`ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL` pointing anywhere but `api.anthropic.com` flips an
internal "first-party base URL" check, and the CLI then builds a *different*
request: different system-prompt sections, no `x-client-request-id`, **no
`x-cc-atis`**, and a separate feature-eval context that (currently) does not
carry the assignment. A naive forwarding proxy therefore appears to "fix" Opus
4.8 without doing anything - the client simply stopped sending the trigger. Set
`_CLAUDE_CODE_ASSUME_FIRST_PARTY_BASE_URL=1` if you need the CLI to build the
real first-party request shape through a local forwarder. (This also means
Option 3 below is not the byte-faithful passthrough its design assumed on
current builds.)

### Mitigation

See the [README's 2026-07-07 update](README.md#2026-07-07-update-opus-48-and-the-experiment-header)
for the verified two-step mitigation (purge the cached assignment, then launch
with `DISABLE_GROWTHBOOK=1`) and its caveats. Server-side assignment can be
widened, narrowed, or ended by Anthropic at any time without a client update.

### Status

Undocumented: no CHANGELOG entry through `2.1.204`, no notice, no opt-in, no
documented opt-out; the documented `showThinkingSummaries` setting is silently
overridden while the assignment is active. Background:
<https://github.com/anthropics/claude-code/issues/63358>. Dedicated upstream
issue: pending (link will be added here once filed).

# Workaround 2: missing context-usage icon

## TL;DR

The context-usage indicator in the VS Code chat input is gated to render only after more than 50% of the context window has been used. With the 1M context window that is about 500,000 tokens, so it is effectively never shown. There is no environment variable or CLI flag for the threshold, so the fix is a one-character-class edit to the extension's webview bundle, re-applied on each launch by the wrapper so it survives updates.

## Root cause (from the webview bundle)

The indicator is a React component in the extension's `webview/index.js`. The bundle is minified, so the component name `FJe` and its helpers (`OJe`, `BIt`, `b0e`, ...) are minifier-assigned and change between builds. Deobfuscated:

```js
function FJe({usedTokens:e, contextWindow:t, onCompact:i, buttonClassName:n}) {
  let a = t > 0 ? Math.min(e / t * 100, 100) : 0,  // a = % used
      l = b0e !== null ? b0e : a,                  // l = % used (b0e is a debug override, normally null)
      c = 100 - l;                                 // c = % REMAINING
  if (b0e === null) {
    if (t === 0) return null;        // no session / no window yet -> hide
    if (c >= 50) return null;        // <-- the gate: hide while >=50% remains
  }
  // ... renders the pie button + tooltip + popup ...
}
```

`c` is the percent of context *remaining*, so `c >= 50` hides the icon whenever at least half the window is free, i.e. it only appears once more than 50% is used. With a 1M window that is 500k tokens. The same guard shape is present in the locally inspected `2.1.131` (`Z/U`) and `2.1.170` (`t/c`) bundles, with different minified names.

The `CLAUDE_CODE_DISABLE_1M_CONTEXT=1` env var that circulates in the issue threads only shrinks the window to 200k so 50% (100k) is reached sooner. It does not touch the threshold and forces giving up the 1M window, so it is not a real fix.

## The fix

```text
if(t===0)return null;if(c>=50)return null}   ->   if(c>=101)return null}/*ccwa-context-icon:t:c*/
```

`c` is in `[0, 100]`, so `c >= 101` is never true and the gate never hides the icon. Removing `if (t === 0) return null` keeps the icon visible across window-reload gaps where the webview has not repopulated usage data yet; the tooltip can briefly read `0%` until the next usage event arrives. Using `>=101` (rather than deleting the line) is the smallest, most legible, greppable, reversible threshold change, while removing the adjacent startup guard addresses the reload case explicitly. The patch is anchored on the combined guard shape `if(<id>===0)return null;if(<id>>=50)return null}`, not the exact minified names. The trailing `/*ccwa-context-icon:<first-var>:<remaining-var>*/` is an ownership marker that stores the matched names: the launcher's reconcile reverses only known patch fingerprints, so it can never corrupt unrelated upstream code; pre-existing legacy patched forms are normalized to pristine and re-applied on the next launch.

There is no integrity or subresource check on the webview bundle (the only `sha256` references in `extension.js` belong to a bundled crypto library), so an edited `index.js` loads normally.

## Delivery: re-patch on each launch

The launcher is registered as the extension's process wrapper (`claudeCode.claudeProcessWrapper`), so the extension invokes it as `<wrapper> <REAL_CLAUDE...> <args...>` every time it spawns the CLI, including the first spawn after an auto-update. That is the ideal place to re-apply a bundle patch: it self-heals across updates with no daemon or cron.

The wrapper discovers `index.js` two ways:

* Precise: walk up from the real `claude` path the extension hands it until a path component matches `anthropic.claude-code-*`, then `<root>/webview/index.js`.
* Fallback: scan the user's `.vscode`, `.vscode-server`, and `.vscode-insiders` extension dirs for `anthropic.claude-code-*/webview/index.js` (covers terminal launches and standalone-CLI installs).

The edit is made safe:

* Idempotent: writes only when the recomputed bytes differ, and skips (rather than guesses) if the combined guard shape is absent because the extension changed.
* Ownership-marked: the edit carries a `/*ccwa-context-icon:<first-var>:<remaining-var>*/` marker; reconcile reverses only its own marked edit and never touches upstream code that merely resembles a patched value. Older `/*ccwa-context-icon*/` forms are treated as legacy fingerprints.
* Atomic: written to a temp file and moved into place only after it is verified non-empty and actually patched, so a failed or partial write cannot corrupt the bundle.
* Metadata-preserving via `cp -p` (portable; the GNU-only `chmod`/`chown --reference` is avoided so it also works on macOS/BSD). The Windows launcher writes with `fs.writeFileSync` + `fs.renameSync`, inheriting the parent directory's ACLs (it does not preserve the file mode - the one intentional bash/node asymmetry).
* Fully guarded so it never blocks the launch (a read-only file, a renamed bundle, or a missing tool simply no-ops).

### Patch composition (per-file reconcile)

Every launch, for each webview file a bundle-patch feature targets, the launcher recomputes the file from scratch rather than restoring a backup:

1. **Clean base C** - apply every KNOWN feature's `undo` in REVERSE registration order. Each `undo` reverses only its own ownership-marked edit and is a no-op when that marker is absent, so C is the pristine bundle regardless of which of our patches were present, and `undo` never touches code we did not write.
2. **Desired D** - apply each ENABLED feature's `apply` to C in FORWARD order. A feature whose anchor is absent (the extension changed the string) no-ops with a one-line warning; it does not abort the file.
3. Write D only if it differs from the current bytes (idempotent). Multiple features on one file compose without cross-clobber; toggling one off removes exactly that feature on the next launch; an extension auto-update that reinstalls a fresh bundle is simply re-applied.

`CC_WORKAROUNDS=0` runs reconcile with every feature disabled, so D == C and the bundle returns to clean. `CC_RECONCILE=0` skips the whole pass (no reads/writes), leaving the bundle exactly as-is.

**Emergency snapshot.** The first time a file is rewritten, a one-time whole-file pristine snapshot `index.js.bak-cc-workarounds` (= C) is written for manual restore only; routine reconcile never reads it. Because it is a whole-file image, manually restoring it is NOT composition-safe (it can clobber another feature's patch); only routine reconcile / `undo` (marker-scoped reverse transforms) composes. The standalone `fix-context-icon.py` keeps its own separate `.bak-context-icon` backup.

Timing note: the wrapper patches `index.js` on disk when the CLI is spawned, which can be *after* the webview already loaded the old bundle. So the first time you enable it you may need two reloads (the spawn patches the file, then the webview loads the patched bundle). Later windows and post-update launches are already patched on disk.

**Append features and multiple files.** A feature is either an *in-place* edit
(context-icon: a marked swap deep in `index.js`) or an *append* (md-copy: a
sentinel-delimited block at end-of-file). Each append feature's `undo` is
marker-scoped block removal (it deletes exactly its own OPEN..CLOSE block and
keeps any bytes after CLOSE), so append features compose with in-place features
and with each other without overlap, regardless of registration order. The reconcile runs per
file with that file's own feature list: `index.js` carries `[context-icon,
md-copy]`; `index.css` carries `[md-copy]`. md-copy's block is byte-identical
across the bash launcher (quoted heredocs), the node launcher (JSON string
literals), and the standalone `add-md-copy.py` (base64): `"\n" + OPEN + "\n" +
PAYLOAD + "\n" + CLOSE + "\n"`, where `OPEN`/`CLOSE` are `/* cc-md-copy v1 */`
and `/* /cc-md-copy v1 */` and `PAYLOAD` is the source with trailing newlines
stripped. The payload's single source is `fixes/markdown-copy-export/webview-inject.{js,css}`;
`tools/gen-embeds` writes the embedded copies and `tools/gen-embeds --check`
fails the build on drift. The standalone `add-md-copy.py` keeps its own
`.bak-md-copy` emergency snapshot; its `--revert` is the same reverse transform
(not a backup restore), so removing md-copy never disturbs a co-applied
context-icon.

## How the icon works (context for future changes)

### Data source resets on reload

`FJe` is fed from a live `usageData` store:

```js
React.createElement(FJe, {
  usedTokens:    e.usageData.value.totalTokens,
  contextWindow: e.usageData.value.contextWindow - e.usageData.value.maxOutputTokens - 13000,
  onCompact:     l,
  // ...

`usageData` initializes to all zeros and is only filled by usage events that arrive during an assistant turn. There is no seeding from `get_claude_state` on resume, so immediately after a window reload of a continued conversation, before any new turn, the store is still empty: the tooltip can read "0% used" until a usage event fills the store with the real totals. The patch removes the `t === 0` hide guard so this state still renders an icon instead of hiding it for the whole reload gap. `/context` does not use this store; it queries the CLI directly, so it always shows the true number.

The transient `0%` is deliberate: it is the same stale-data symptom the extension can already show, and it is less confusing than no icon at all after a reload.

### The glyph is a coarse 3-state gauge

```js
function BIt(e){ if(e<62.5) return 50; if(e<87) return 75; return 99 }  // e = % used
```

`BIt` maps percent-used to one of three bucket keys (`50`, `75`, `99`) that index arc-path lookup tables for the SVG. So the pie has only three visual states: below 62.5% used, 62.5 to 87%, and above 87%. It does not track 12% vs 30% vs 50%; it is a "getting full" warning light, which made sense when it was only shown past 50% used. The precise figure lives in the hover tooltip and the popup, and in `/context`. Making the pie a continuous gauge would require new SVG geometry, not a string patch, so it is out of scope.

### Click behavior

The pie button's `onClick` is `onCompact`: clicking the icon triggers compaction, not opening `/context`. Opening the detailed panel is the `/context` command. These are kept distinct.

## Compatibility

Confirmed on VS Code extension `2.1.169` (native-binary CLI) on Windows 11 and Ubuntu 24.04. The same guard shape has been observed with different minified names (`Z/U` in `2.1.131`, `t/c` in `2.1.170`). The patch keys off that shape, not the minified component name or exact variable names; if a future build changes the shape, the launcher safely no-ops (the icon goes missing again) until the anchor is updated. The standalone [`fix-context-icon.py`](fixes/context-icon/fix-context-icon.py) applies the same change directly and supports `--revert`.
